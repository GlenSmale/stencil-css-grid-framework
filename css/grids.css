 * Set of standard CSS Grid template layouts

/* An HTML element becomes a grid container 
when its display property is set to grid or 
inline-grid.

You can adjust the gap size by using one of 
the following properties:

(column-gap:) property sets the gap between 
the columns: column-gap: 50px;

(row-gap:) property sets the gap between 
the rows: row-gap: 50px;

(gap) property is a shorthand property for 
the row-gap and the column-gap properties:
gap: 50px 100px;

The gap property can also be used to set both 
the row gap and the column gap in one value:
gap: 100px;

Grid Lines
The lines between columns are called column lines.
The lines between rows are called row lines.
